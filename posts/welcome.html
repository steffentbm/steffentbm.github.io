<p>Hello world! Welcome to my new corner of the internet.</p>

<p>I decided to build this blog from scratch using only the fundamental building blocks of the web:
    <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. No heavy frameworks, no complex build
    tools, just simple, clean code.</p>

<h2>Why Minimalist?</h2>

<p>In a world of information overload, I wanted a space that feels calm and focused. The design reflects this
    philosophy:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>High Contrast:</strong> Easy to read text.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean Typography:</strong> Using Inter for a modern look.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Performance:</strong> No bloat means instant loading times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to tweak and improve this site!</p>
